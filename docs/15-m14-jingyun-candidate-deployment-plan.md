# M14 Jingyun Candidate Deployment Plan

CANDIDATE - DO NOT APPLY.

This is a repository-only staging plan for the Tiny IPA namespace accepted for
candidate generation: `ipa.jingyun.bj.cn`, `/opt/tiny-ipa`,
`/var/www/tiny-ipa`, `/var/lib/tiny-ipa`, `/var/backups/tiny-ipa`,
`tiny-ipa-api.service`, and backend bind `127.0.0.1:18110`.

This plan does not authorize SSH, VPS reads, package installation, host writes,
operating-system user or directory creation, secret generation, database
creation or mutation, systemd/Nginx/firewall/DNS/TLS changes, service
start/restart/reload, backup, restore, rollback, or deployment.

## Candidate Artifact Set

- `deploy/jingyun/tiny-ipa-api.service.candidate`: review-only systemd unit.
- `deploy/jingyun/ipa.jingyun.bj.cn.nginx.candidate`: review-only Nginx server block.
- `deploy/jingyun/tiny-ipa.production.env.example`: non-secret environment example.
- `deploy/jingyun/REVISION.candidate`: active-release readback convention.
- `docs/16-m14-jingyun-production-backup-restore-plan.md`: production backup/restore plan.

Every artifact must keep `CANDIDATE - DO NOT APPLY` visible until a later
Human-owned host action explicitly replaces it with an approved operational
file.

## Required Pre-State Evidence

Before any future host mutation, a Human-authorized operator must collect
sanitized evidence for the current host, current date, running services,
listener list, available capacity, and the absence or known ownership of every
Tiny IPA namespace path. The Xue Tu Zhi Ban baseline must be recorded through an
owner-approved application health check, not inferred from Tiny IPA health or a
systemd active state alone.

Stop before mutation when any of these are missing or ambiguous:

- approved service user: `<HUMAN_APPROVED_TINY_IPA_SERVICE_USER>`;
- approved service group: `<HUMAN_APPROVED_TINY_IPA_SERVICE_GROUP>`;
- Human-owned environment file: `<HUMAN_OWNED_TINY_IPA_ENV_FILE>`;
- TLS certificate ownership for `ipa.jingyun.bj.cn`;
- secret provisioning channel for `TINY_IPA_SESSION_SECRET`;
- backup owner and retention policy;
- rollback owner and acceptable data-loss boundary;
- Xue Tu Zhi Ban baseline health evidence.

## Staged Release Shape

Use immutable release directories and active-release pointers only after later
authorization:

```text
/opt/tiny-ipa/releases/<release-id>
/opt/tiny-ipa/current -> /opt/tiny-ipa/releases/<release-id>
/opt/tiny-ipa/current/REVISION
/var/www/tiny-ipa/releases/<release-id>
/var/www/tiny-ipa/current -> /var/www/tiny-ipa/releases/<release-id>
/var/lib/tiny-ipa/tiny-ipa.sqlite
/var/lib/tiny-ipa/audio
/var/backups/tiny-ipa
```

The frontend build must use `VITE_API_BASE=/api`. The backend must read
`TINY_IPA_DB_PATH=/var/lib/tiny-ipa/tiny-ipa.sqlite` and
`TINY_IPA_AUDIO_DIR=/var/lib/tiny-ipa/audio`. The deployed origin must be
exactly `https://ipa.jingyun.bj.cn`, with `TINY_IPA_COOKIE_SECURE=true` and
`TINY_IPA_COOKIE_SAMESITE=lax`.

## Release Identity and Version Readback

GitHub is the source of truth for every deployable release. A later
Human-authorized operator must select one explicit immutable identity before any
host mutation:

```text
release_id=<INTENDED_GIT_COMMIT_OR_TAG_RELEASE_ID>
commit=<INTENDED_GITHUB_COMMIT_SHA>
tag=<OPTIONAL_SIGNED_OR_ANNOTATED_GIT_TAG>
previous_release=<PREVIOUS_ACTIVE_RELEASE_ID_RECORDED_BEFORE_CHANGE>
rollback_pointer=<PREVIOUS_ACTIVE_RELEASE_PATH_RECORDED_BEFORE_CHANGE>
```

Do not deploy from uncommitted local files, direct VPS edits, local-only patches,
or an unpushed branch. The intended release must be visible on GitHub before it
is copied or built for the VPS.

Each backend release directory must contain a generated `REVISION` file with
the same release ID, commit, optional tag, and timestamp shape as
`deploy/jingyun/REVISION.candidate`. The backend environment must set:

```dotenv
TINY_IPA_RELEASE_ID=<INTENDED_GIT_COMMIT_OR_TAG_RELEASE_ID>
TINY_IPA_RELEASE_COMMIT=<INTENDED_GITHUB_COMMIT_SHA>
TINY_IPA_RELEASE_TAG=<OPTIONAL_SIGNED_OR_ANNOTATED_GIT_TAG>
```

The live backend exposes only these explicit non-secret environment fields at
`/api/version`, with `Cache-Control: no-store`. It does not read or return the
contents of `REVISION` or any operator-selected file path. After any later
authorized activation, the operator must compare the disk and API evidence as
separate sources:

```text
local git rev-parse HEAD
intended GitHub commit/tag
/opt/tiny-ipa/current/REVISION
GET https://ipa.jingyun.bj.cn/api/version
```

Stop before public activation when any of these identities differ, when
`/api/version` is unreachable, or when the active `current` pointer does not
match the pre-recorded release directory.

## Validation Before Activation

Each later phase must validate before moving to the next phase:

1. Record pre-state evidence and Xue Tu Zhi Ban baseline health.
2. Verify the candidate service user is not root and owns only the approved Tiny IPA paths.
3. Verify port `18110` is still free before any backend start.
4. Record the intended GitHub commit/tag, previous active release, and rollback pointer.
5. Generate `REVISION` in the candidate release directory before any `current` pointer change.
6. Validate the systemd unit syntax without enabling or starting it.
7. Build the frontend with `VITE_API_BASE=/api` before any web-root pointer change.
8. Validate the Nginx candidate without reload and confirm it owns only `ipa.jingyun.bj.cn`.
9. Re-check Xue Tu Zhi Ban health before requesting any proxy reload or public activation.
10. Run Tiny IPA health, `/api/version`, login, Settings save, Today resume,
    and `/audio/` checks only after the relevant host action is authorized.
11. Compare local/GitHub/REVISION/live `/api/version` release identity before
    considering the phase valid.
12. Re-check Xue Tu Zhi Ban health after each authorized phase.

## Stop Conditions

Stop and route to Architect/Human owner before mutation if any proposed command,
diff, or path would touch `/opt/hermes`, `/var/www/hermes-web`,
`/home/ubuntu/.hermes`, Redis, `xuetuzhiban-api.service`, `jingyun.bj.cn` root
routes, existing Nginx defaults, occupied backend ports 3000, 5173, 8000, 8001,
8002, 8010, or 6379, private application data, real secrets, or real
certificate files.

Stop after validation, before activation, if Tiny IPA health succeeds but Xue
Tu Zhi Ban health is missing or regressed. Tiny IPA success never substitutes
for the higher-priority application baseline.

Stop before pointer changes, proxy activation, or smoke completion if the
previous release ID, previous active path, rollback owner, or rollback pointer
is missing. A rollback plan without a concrete previous-release pointer is not a
rollback plan.

## Later Authorization Boundary

A future host-action request must name the exact phase, release ID, files to
transfer, command list, expected output, rollback owner
`<HUMAN_APPROVED_ROLLBACK_OWNER>`, and backup owner
`<HUMAN_APPROVED_BACKUP_OWNER>`. Approval for this candidate plan alone does
not authorize applying any artifact.
